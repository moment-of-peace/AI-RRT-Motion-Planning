# AI-RRT-Motion-Planning

Using rapidly exploring random tree to solve high-dimension motion planning problems. In this program, the main task is to make a robot consisting of line segments find a path to the goal in a workspace filled with rectangular obstacles. A query file firstly defines all the vertex (called ASV here) coordinates of the robot when it is in initial and goal states respectively, then defines the vertex coordinates of all the obstacles. Next, this program will use a series intermediate states to decribe the path from the initial to the goal states, and when the robot moves from any of such states to the next state, the maximum moving distance of its vertices should be less than 0.001 (step size).
